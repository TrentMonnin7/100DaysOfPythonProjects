This program will test the compatibility between two people by 
taking both of their nmes and checking for the the amount of times the 
letters in both "True" and "Love" appear in each. Then it will combine
these numbers to make a two digit number that is the "compatibility
score" between the two people. 

Final results should look like:

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90 the message should be: 
"Your score is X, you go together like coke and mentos"

For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
"Your score is X, you are alright together"

Otherwise, the message will just be their score:
"Your score is X"
